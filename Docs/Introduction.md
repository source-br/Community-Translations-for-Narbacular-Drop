# Introduction

The translation project aims to provide all in-game textures containing readable text in an editable format, so they can be adapted into other languages.

### First, we will introduce you to the basic information of the project:

`Total number of textures:` 10
```
File.ore
├── files/
│   └── video: 10
```
In other words, the project is mainly based on the `File.ore` (the game’s asset file), which contains textures in `.jpg` and `.dds` formats, as well as `.cmf` files (maps). We extract them from the `File.ore` and place them inside `EN/Original`, then create editable versions of the textures in `.psd` format inside the `EN/Recreation` folder, keeping the same folder structure as in `File.ore`.
